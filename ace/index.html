<summary>Intro</summary> <p>An Analytics Center of Excellence (<abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr>) is a dedicated team or function within an organization that is responsible for promoting and enabling the use of data analytics to support business objectives. The goal of an <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> is to provide a centralized resource for data analytics expertise, tools, and processes that can be leveraged across the organization to drive data-driven decision making and innovation. Some key responsibilities of an <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> include:</p> <ul> <li>Defining and enforcing data governance policies and standards.</li> <li>Identifying and prioritizing data analytics use cases.</li> <li>Providing guidance and support to business units in the development and execution of data analytics projects.</li> <li>Developing and maintaining a data analytics roadmap and strategy.</li> <li>Providing training and enablement to data analysts and other team members.</li> <li>Evaluating and selecting data analytics tools and technologies.</li> </ul> <p>The goal of an <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> is to help organizations derive value from their data assets by providing a centralized resource for data analytics expertise, tools, and processes. </p> </details> <details class=note> <summary>Executive Sponsorship</summary> <h2 id=executive-sponsorship>Executive Sponsorship<a class=headerlink href=#executive-sponsorship title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Full executive sponsorship is critical for the success of an Analytics Center of Excellence (<abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr>). </p> <p>Here are the four main reasons:</p> <p><figure markdown> <a class=glightbox data-desc-position=bottom data-height=auto data-title="Executive Sponsorship" data-width=100% href=/assets/ace/executive-sponsorship.png><img alt="Executive Sponsorship" src=/assets/ace/executive-sponsorship.png width=800></a> </figure></p> <p>Executive sponsorship is critical for the success of an Analytics <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> because it helps to ensure that the <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> has the buy-in and support, alignment with business objectives, governance and oversight, and visibility and influence needed to deliver value to the organization.</p> </details> <details class=note> <summary>Building a Data-Driven Culture: The Role of Communication, Engagement, and Collaboration</summary> <h2 id=building-a-data-driven-culture-the-role-of-communication-engagement-and-collaboration>Building a Data-Driven Culture: The Role of Communication, Engagement, and Collaboration<a class=headerlink href=#building-a-data-driven-culture-the-role-of-communication-engagement-and-collaboration title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Effective data analytics culture in an organization is built on a foundation of strong communication, engagement, and collaboration. One key element of this is regular office hours or "ask me anything" sessions, in which team members can ask questions, seek guidance, and share insights with one another. Outreach to the broader organization, through events, community building initiatives, and other forms of engagement, can also be important for fostering a data-driven culture. Establishing a feedback loop, through which team members can share their experiences and ideas, is another key component of building a successful data analytics culture. Finally, social proof - the idea that people are more likely to adopt a certain behavior or attitude if they see others doing the same - can be a powerful force in driving the adoption of data analytics practices and tools within an organization. By focusing on these key elements, organizations can build a culture that is conducive to the effective use of data analytics to drive business decisions and outcomes.</p> </details> <details class=note> <summary><abbr title="Operationalizing Data Analytics Methodology">ODAM</abbr> for Setting Up a Successful Analytics Center of Excellence: Key High-Level Activities</summary> <h2 id=odam-for-setting-up-a-successful-analytics-center-of-excellence-key-high-level-activities><abbr title="Operationalizing Data Analytics Methodology">ODAM</abbr> for Setting Up a Successful Analytics Center of Excellence: Key High-Level Activities<a class=headerlink href=#odam-for-setting-up-a-successful-analytics-center-of-excellence-key-high-level-activities title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>When it comes to using <abbr title="Operationalizing Data Analytics Methodology">ODAM</abbr> to set up your analytics center of excellence (<abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr>), there are key activities that are critical to the organization’s overall success.

It is based on the idea that risk should be understood and managed in a consistent and objective way, using a common language and set of principles.</p> <p>The FAIR approach is based on five key principles:</p> <ol> <li>Risk is a function of the likelihood of an event occurring and the impact of that event.</li> <li>Risk should be measured in terms of loss exposure, which is the potential financial impact of a risk event.</li> <li>Risk assessment should be based on objective and quantifiable data, rather than subjective opinions or assumptions.</li> <li>Risk management should be an ongoing process, rather than a one-time event.</li> <li>Risk management should be based on a consistent and repeatable process, using a common language and set of principles.</li> </ol> <p>The FAIR approach provides a framework for understanding and managing cyber risk in a consistent and objective way, using a common language and set of principles.

For instance, negative impacts to private businesses are different from those of the impacts to county governments. If a ransomware event happens in a business, the impact could be lost revenue and lost productivity. If a ransomware event happens in a county, terrible, life-threatening circumstances can arise. County’s usually operate jails and other essential services like (e)911. If a ransomware attack prevents doors from opening or phone lines to ring, people could lose their lives. </p> <p><figure markdown> <a class=glightbox data-desc-position=bottom data-height=auto data-title="Measuring and managing Information Risk" data-width=100% href=/assets/ace/measuring-risk.png><img alt="Measuring and managing Information Risk" src=/assets/ace/measuring-risk.png width=800></a> <figcaption>(Measuring and Managing Information Risk; A FAIR Approach)</figcaption> </figure></p> <p>Over the last decade I’ve observed many ways and attempts of describing risk, priority, and worst case scenarios.

It is tempting to think that every KPI and visualization a user could want is on their dashboard out of the box but as we all know, there is some assembly required.</p> <p>If we’ve already created an IT Service Blueprint for one of the organization’s services, we can begin to ask our personas questions about what KPIs are going to be most meaningful and important off the bat. This could be a measurement of capacity or speed. The bare bones of a dashboard are assembled to create the <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> for this persona and over the next months or quarters, it will be up to the <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> to solicit and collect feedback from the end user community. </p> <p>Planning for Ask Me Anything sessions or Office Hours can be a good way to make the <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> a welcoming place.</p> <p>As end users come to these office hours and talk to one another as well as the <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr>, they can begin to share their lessons learned and experiences with one another. This helps build and foster community and trust which ultimately creates culture.</p> <p>Let’s summarize some typical steps when launching an <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr>:</p> <ul> <li>Define the problem that the persona is trying to solve and determine the applicable KPIs or insights to include in the <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr>.</li> <li>Define the persona and user group. </li> <li>Identify key features like filtering or the ability to select from a dropdown list.</li> <li>Design and develop the dashboard or schedule reports.</li> <li>Create a prototype.</li> <li>Testing and validation of the <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr>.</li> <li>Launch the <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr>! Make it available to users and begin gathering data and feedback to inform future development.</li> <li>Finally, iterate and evolve. Use the data and feedback gathered from the <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> to refine and improve the product, and to add new features and functionality over time. Don’t forget to communicate with your user community along the way! </li> </ul> <p>The goal of launching an <abbr title="Minimum Viable Product">MVP</abbr> is to quickly and efficiently test and validate a product concept, and to gather insights and feedback that can inform future development.</p> </details> <hr> <div class=md-source-file> <small> Last update: <span class="git-revision-date-localized-plugin git-revision-date-localized-plugin-date">March 8, 2023</span> </small> </div> </article> </div> </div> <a class="md-top md-icon" data-md-component=top hidden href=#> <svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M13 20h-2V8l-5.5 5.5-1.42-1.42L12 4.16l7.92 7.92-1.42 1.42L13 8v12Z"></path></svg> Back to top </a> </main> <footer class=md-footer> <!-- Link to previous and/or next page --> <nav aria-label=Footer class="md-footer__inner md-grid"> <!-- Link to previous page --> <a aria-label="Previous: 2-Data Strategy Template" class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--prev" href=../strategy-template/ rel=prev> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M20 11v2H8l5.5 5.5-1.42 1.42L4.16 12l7.92-7.92L13.5 5.5 8 11h12Z"></path></svg> </div> <div class=md-footer__title> <div class=md-ellipsis> <span class=md-footer__direction> Previous </span> 2-Data Strategy Template </div> </div> </a> <!-- Link to next page --> <a aria-label="Next: 4-Getting Tactical" class="md-footer__link md-footer__link--next" href=../getting-tactical/ rel=next> <div class=md-footer__title> <div class=md-ellipsis> <span class=md-footer__direction> Next </span> 4-Getting Tactical </div> </div> <div class="md-footer__button md-icon"> <svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M4 11v2h12l-5.5 5.5 1.42 1.42L19.84 12l-7.92-7.92L10.5 5.5 16 11H4Z"></path></svg> </div> </a> </nav> <!-- Further information --> <div class="md-footer-meta md-typeset"> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <!-- Additional Resources --> <div class=resources> <h4>Additional Resources</h4> <p><a href=/assets/Splunk_ODAM_Overview.pdf target=_blank>ODAM Overview</a></p> </div> </div> <div class="md-footer-meta__inner md-grid"> <!-- Copyright and theme information --> <div class=md-copyright> <div class=md-copyright__highlight> Copyright © 2023 Chris Perkins — <a href=#__consent>Change cookie settings</a> </div> Made with <span class="twemoji heart"> <svg viewbox="0 0 24 24" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><path d="M14 20.408c-.492.308-.903.546-1.192.709-.153.086-.308.17-.463.252h-.002a.75.75 0 0 1-.686 0 16.709 16.709 0 0 1-.465-.252 31.147 31.147 0 0 1-4.803-3.34C3.8 15.572 1 12.331 1 8.513 1 5.052 3.829 2.5 6.736 2.5 9.03 2.5 10.881 3.726 12 5.605 13.12 3.726 14.97 2.5 17.264 2.5 20.17 2.5 23 5.052 23 8.514c0 3.818-2.801 7.06-5.389 9.262A31.146 31.146 0 0 1 14 20.408Z"></path></svg> </span> by <a href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/zachthesplunker/ target=_blank>ZachTheSplunker</a> using <a href=https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/ rel=noopener target=_blank> Material for MkDocs </a> </div> <!-- Social links --> <div class=md-social> <a class=md-social__link href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/cperkins2/ rel=noopener target=_blank title=www.linkedin.com> <svg viewbox="0 0 448 512" xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg><!-- Font Awesome Free 6.3.0 by @fontawesome - https://fontawesome.com License - https://fontawesome.com/license/free (Icons: CC BY 4.0, Fonts: SIL OFL 1.1, Code: MIT License) Copyright 2023 Fonticons, Inc.--><path d="M416 32H31.9C14.3 32 0 46.5 0 64.3v383.4C0 465.5 14.3 480 31.9 480H416c17.6 0 32-14.5 32-32.3V64.3c0-17.8-14.4-32.3-32-32.3zM135.4 416H69V202.2h66.5V416zm-33.2-243c-21.3 0-38.5-17.3-38.5-38.5S80.9 96 102.2 96c21.2 0 38.5 17.3 38.5 38.5 0 21.3-17.2 38.5-38.5 38.5zm282.1 243h-66.4V312c0-24.8-.5-56.7-34.5-56.7-34.6 0-39.9 27-39.9 54.9V416h-66.4V202.2h63.7v29.2h.9c8.9-16.8 30.6-34.5 62.9-34.5 67.2 0 79.7 44.3 79.7 101.9V416z"></path></svg> </a> </div> </div> </div> </footer> </div> <div class=md-dialog data-md-component=dialog> <div class="md-dialog__inner md-typeset"></div> </div> <div class=md-consent data-md-component=consent hidden id=__consent> <div class=md-consent__overlay></div> <aside class=md-consent__inner> <form class="md-consent__form md-grid md-typeset" name=consent> <h4>Cookie consent</h4> <p>We use cookies to recognize your repeated visits and preferences, as well as to measure the effectiveness of our site and whether users find what they're searching for.
