Splunk is software that helps people understand and make sense of their data.</p> <p>This data story begins at the Dripping Springs trailhead in the Organ Mountains in Southern New Mexico, which recently became a protected national monument. Before setting out on my hike, I used my phone to check the weather forecast and made sure to pack my rain jacket. As I started my hike, I wore my Apple Watch, which tracked my GPS location, blood oxygen levels, heart rate, and other telemetry. My phone and watch provided me with real-time information about the weather and my location as I hiked. When it began to rain, I consulted my phone's weather radar app and decided to continue based on the information it provided and my own observations.</p> <p>The desert smells wonderful when it rains. The hot ground is cooled as rain drops evaporate. The hike was enjoyable, and my trail app showed me that I had traveled a total distance of 4.95 miles in 2.5 hours, climbed 62 flights of stairs, and burned 1440 calories. It also recorded my heart rate and oxygen levels at 5-minute intervals throughout the hike. This is just one example of the vast amount of data that can be generated and consumed in a single activity. </p> <p>All of the devices I had with me, including my phone, smartwatch, headphones, and even my AirPods, were capable of generating and streaming data. Two of these devices, my phone and watch, were also connected to cellular networks and had GPS capabilities. These devices provided me with valuable information when I needed it and also captured my personal biometric data, giving me insights into how my body responded to the hike. Let's look at a few more examples of how data and insights can be useful. Some examples of data that were valuable to me include:</p> <ul> <li>Weather data: This was useful to me before and during my hike, but would not be valuable to me a week after the hike.</li> <li>Location information: This was useful to me in real-time to show my exact location on a map and also valuable to me after the hike so I could look back at where I had previously hiked.</li> <li>Health information: This is valuable to me when aggregated with other data, as it allows me to see trends over time and track my fitness metrics.</li> <li>Geolocation information embedded in photos: This will be valuable to me when I want to filter my photos by location.</li> </ul> <p>It's important to note that not all data is valuable after the fact. In my case, an incredible amount of data was generated, collected, and analyzed during my hike, and this data was valuable to different people and at different times. For example, the data collected by my devices was useful to me when I wanted to track my fitness or explore my hiking routes, but it might not be as valuable to someone else.</p> <p>It's also worth considering that even when our devices are turned off, data is still being generated. The absence of data can be a data point in itself. For example, a cellular provider might be interested in knowing when 1% or more of all connected cell phones disconnect and stop sending data.</p> <p>At the center of all this is me, the consumer of insights and the generator of data through my use of devices. As I use these devices for different activities and tasks, I create patterns and routines that are unique to me, and the way I navigate digital spaces becomes a data point in itself. Ultimately, I believe that data is evidence of our relationship with machines.</p> <div class="admonition quote"> <p class=admonition-title>Maybe stories are just data with a soul.</p> <p><strong>Brené Brown Research Professor and Author</strong></p> </div> </details> <details class=note> <summary>Bringing Data to Life: A Practical Approach to Building an Analytics Center of Excellence</summary> <h2 id=bringing-data-to-life-a-practical-approach-to-building-an-analytics-center-of-excellence>Bringing Data to Life: A Practical Approach to Building an Analytics Center of Excellence<a class=headerlink href=#bringing-data-to-life-a-practical-approach-to-building-an-analytics-center-of-excellence title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Data is a valuable resource, just like water is in arid regions like New Mexico. In the same way that farmers must carefully manage their water rights and usage through contracts and agreements, organizations must also carefully manage their data to get the most value out of it. One way to do this is by building an Analytics Center of Excellence (<abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr>), which can help an organization make the most of its data by providing a central hub for data analytics and visualization.</p> <p><figure markdown> <a class=glightbox data-desc-position=bottom data-height=auto data-title=ACE data-width=100% href=/assets/data-is-beautiful/ace.png><img alt=ACE src=/assets/data-is-beautiful/ace.png width=800></a> </figure></p> <p>The poem "Spring" by Jimmy Santiago Baca describes the arrival of spring in North New Mexico, as water flows into the acequia and brings life to the community fields. The acequia (ə-ˈsā-kē-ə), or network of canals, acts as a conduit for water, just as networks of data conduits can help organizations distribute insights and information to users.</p> <p>In the same way that the acequia association helps to manage water rights and ensure the smooth bureaucratic flow of water to the fields, an <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> can help an organization manage data rights and ensure the smooth flow of data insights to users. The <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> can serve as a resource for answering questions and addressing issues related to data analytics.</p> <details class=tip> <summary>Aspirations of an <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr></summary> <h3 id=aspirations-of-an-ace>Aspirations of an <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr><a class=headerlink href=#aspirations-of-an-ace title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3> <p>The Seven Goals (aka, <a href=https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/2376629/dod-issues-new-data-strategy/ target=_blank>VAULTIS</a>) to become a data-centric organization, as outlined by the Department of Defense, are:</p> <ol> <li>Make Data Visible: Enabling consumers of data to easily locate and search for the data they need.</li> <li>Make Data Accessible: Ensuring consumers of data can retrieve and access the data they need.</li> <li>Make Data Understandable: Ensuring that the context, content and applicability of the data is clear and comprehensive</li> <li>Make Data Linked: Exploiting innate relationships between data elements to allow easy connections and understanding of relationships</li> <li>Make Data Trustworthy: Implementing robust data quality controls to ensure data is accurate, complete, and up-to-date</li> <li>Make Data Interoperable: Implementing standards for data representation and comprehension, to ensure easy sharing and use across different systems and platforms</li> <li>Make Data Secure: Protecting consumer data from unauthorized use or manipulation by implementing security controls and measures such as encryption, access controls, and monitoring systems.</li> </ol> <p>Achieving these goals would help an organization to become data-centric, which would allow them to make better data-driven decisions, identify opportunities for innovation, and improve overall efficiency. With the ability to monitor real-time actions and gather evidence across channels, it is important to ensure that the service meets the needs and expectations of customers and users. By achieving these seven goals, organizations will ensure that data is discoverable, accessible, usable, linked, and trustworthy.</p> <p>Here are some potential impacts that an <abbr title="Analytics Center of Excellence">ACE</abbr> may have in your environment.</p> <p><figure markdown> <a class=glightbox data-desc-position=bottom data-height=auto data-title="Impacts of an ACE" data-width=100% href=/assets/data-is-beautiful/impacts.png><img alt="Impacts of an ACE" src=/assets/data-is-beautiful/impacts.png width=800></a> </figure></p> </details> </details> <details class=note> <summary>Understanding the Hierarchy of Data Value</summary> <h2 id=understanding-the-hierarchy-of-data-value>Understanding the Hierarchy of Data Value<a class=headerlink href=#understanding-the-hierarchy-of-data-value title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>When it comes to data, not all data are created equal. In fact, there are different tiers of value when it comes to data, each serving a specific purpose.</p> <ul> <li>Tier 1 data is considered the most valuable, as it is used frequently and requires quick access. This type of data is typically stored on high-speed storage systems for efficient searching.</li> <li>Tier 2 data is accessed less frequently, and therefore is stored on different storage systems. It may not require the same level of speed as Tier 1 data, but it is still considered important to the organization.</li> <li>Tier 3 data is considered the least valuable, but it is still important for compliance purposes such as eDiscovery. This type of data is stored long-term, but is not accessed as frequently as the other tiers.</li> </ul> <p>The value of data can be determined by a number of factors, including search frequency, performance, capabilities, classification, compliance, governance, and location. For example, firewall logs may be important for cybersecurity and IT operations, but not necessarily for the desktop support team.</p> <p>By understanding the hierarchy of data value, organizations can better align their IT infrastructure and contextualize their data for the appropriate audience. Using the IT Service Blueprint method, organizations can map out the technology used to provide IT services to specific populations of users. This helps to ensure that the right data is being collected, stored, and accessed in the most efficient and effective way possible. </p> </details> <details class=note> <summary>The Role of Data Analytics in Transforming Decision Making Processes</summary> <h2 id=the-role-of-data-analytics-in-transforming-decision-making-processes>The Role of Data Analytics in Transforming Decision Making Processes<a class=headerlink href=#the-role-of-data-analytics-in-transforming-decision-making-processes title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>Ultimately this comes down to: <em>what should I do right now vs. what can I delay or hold off on until the priorities are taken care of?</em></p> <p>When you use data to navigate in a new city or check the weather in your current location, you have applied value to that insight. This is proven by you taking the action of bringing out your phone or glancing at your smart watch. When your gaze lands on the weather app icons, you have placed some trust into the weather insights and can make a decision based on current and trustworthy information. </p> <p>Out of curiosity, would you wait up to 30 seconds for weather data for the trip you are taking next week? Would you wait up to a minute… or five? What if you had to wait an entire day for the insights? There is a balance between time, availability, usefulness, and accessibility when it comes to data-driven decision making. If I have to fumble through a series of clicks on my phone to get the weather forecast, I might just revert to the news on TV or a newspaper. If neither of those are available, I will just take my umbrella anyway!</p> <p>There’s a common thread across every level of an organization - that is, we all want to make the best choice for the business, the customer, and the team. In some cases (Public Sector), there is a life or death scenario that must be factored into every decision when it comes to IT. If someone’s life depends on it, would you install a secondary (backup) internet connection? Did you know that there is very little (if any) regulation on how counties are to prepare the IT environment in the interest of human life. In other words, the jail’s internet connection goes down and risk goes up. What if there were a backup, secondary ISP (internet service provider) providing access so that the doors can be opened - allowing medical response personnel access to a detainee who is having a seizure.</p> <p>If we are to put this much effort into our technology to prevent the loss of life, we surely need to be able to trust the data. If an ambulance does not have the correct information on the patient and how to get to them, they could increase the risk of someone losing their life. The ambulance needs to be able to not only navigate efficiently to the scene, but also navigate to the hospital while providing life-saving care. </p> <p>We don’t have time to get into it, but all of this makes me think of entropy, likelihood, and possibilities. The possibilities are endless and equally exciting. The power of data analytics has transformed our day-to-day lives and will continue to do so. We are in the midst of something big. Web3, blockchain, decentralized systems, IoT, and AI are all emerging technologies that will change our world.</p> <p>Endless, huh?…. So where does one begin? What is the best course of action?</p> </details> <details class=note> <summary>Storytelling With Data</summary> <h2 id=storytelling-with-data>Storytelling With Data<a class=headerlink href=#storytelling-with-data title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <div class="admonition quote"> <p class=admonition-title>Stories have been used to dispossess and malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize. Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that broken dignity.</p> <p><strong>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, The Danger of a Single Story, TED Talk</strong></p> </div> <p>There are many wonderful people out there creating content and enablement material (practical wisdom) about storytelling with data. Brent Dykes wrote an excellent book called, Effective Data Storytelling and Cole Nussbaumer Knaflic has published multiple books; Storytelling With Data and recently, Storytelling With You. </p> <p>What I will say here in this article is this: 1) get and read those books and 2) start by telling your data story. What do you measure, monitor, and track? For me, I religiously track my spend on fuel in a smartphone app that tracks gas mileage. I can look at this app’s dashboard for my vehicle and tell you exactly (I have missed a few fill ups) how much I spent on fuel in the last 182,000 miles. I can tell you how much I have spent (approximately) on fuel in the last 10 years. This app tells me a lot and has many more capabilities to track maintenance like oil changes and tires. Why do I use it? I have been tracking different things since I figured out how to use spreadsheets…. It’s a thing I do! But… through that experience, I reckon (John Dutton voice) it is helpful to share your data story with other people. This will help us all practice and find common language. </p> <p>Jordan Morrow writes in his book, Be Data Literate, about the lack of a common language with regard to data. He also talks about the four levels of analytics; descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive and the three Cs - which I’ll cover later in Part III. When we frame things using these four levels, we can identify our common language. </p> <p>The gas mileage app is providing me with descriptive analytics about spend, fuel consumption, vehicle wear and tear, and maintenance. If the mile per gallon suddenly drops, we can ask why and look for an answer. Was it because of headwinds, towing, or because I was late and driving fast. (Of course I would never speed!)</p> <p>Based on these insights, I can predict how much I will spend on fuel next month or next year.</p> <p>As you read in the beginning of this writing, I attempted to capture your interest and attention with my data story. As you find new ways to share how you consume and generate data, you also begin developing new ways of hearing data stories. The US Census made a lot more sense to me when I learned more about how data is collected and used. This becomes incredibly important when it comes to demographics or social profiles. As these skills develop, one might see Facebook, TikTok, and other social media apps a little differently simply based on the fact that your data is being used for their financial gain. But I digress! </p> <p>Stories are powerful as you read in this section’s opening quote. Chimamanda accurately points out that stories are so powerful that they can replace governments, marginalize groups or individuals, or create division where there might not be (or not as much). </p> <p>With so many stories and attempts to capture your attention, we - as people - tend to become overwhelmed. There is a lot of noise, many signals, and sometimes too many options. How do we decide?</p> <div class="admonition quote"> <p class=admonition-title>A wealth of information creates a poverty of attention.</p> <p><strong>Herbert A. Simon, Economist and Political Scientist</strong></p> </div> <p>As individuals, we often make tough decisions based on our values and ethics. These core beliefs guide us and help us navigate difficult situations. Similarly, in business, we rely on frameworks, standards, protocols, and processes to guide our decision-making. We may measure our progress against established baselines to ensure that we are on track.</p> <p>When it comes to discussing data and insights, it is important to provide context and background information to help listeners understand and calibrate their thinking. For example, if we are discussing cybersecurity capabilities, we might use the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework to describe our progress in preventing lateral movement. By providing a clear and concise description of the insights being discussed, and how they align with a well-known framework or baseline, we can enable others to make informed decisions.</p> <p>In today's world, it is crucial that we learn to identify and call out misinformation. Misinformation and propaganda have always been present, but with the proliferation of digital media, it is more important than ever to be able to distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources. By establishing a common language and understanding, we can have more meaningful and effective communication and discussions.</p> <div class="admonition quote"> <p class=admonition-title>It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data.</p> <p><strong>Sherlock Holmes A Study in Scarlet, Arthur Conan Doyle</strong></p> </div> <details class=tip> <summary>Storytelling with Data: The Importance of Considering the User</summary> <h3 id=storytelling-with-data-the-importance-of-considering-the-user>Storytelling with Data: The Importance of Considering the User<a class=headerlink href=#storytelling-with-data-the-importance-of-considering-the-user title="Permanent link">¶</a></h3> <p>The success of any data storytelling lies in its ability to engage and reach the emotion of the audience. It is crucial to consider who your audience is and tailor your presentation accordingly. While a technical audience with a high level of data literacy may be able to comprehend more complex language and visualizations, a non-technical audience may require simpler explanations, basic data visualizations, or a walk-through of what’s being presented. Using metaphors and analogies are very helpful tools when customizing your presentation or content.</p> <p>It is also essential to consider their goals, interests, and motivations. What do they hope to learn from the data? How can the insights from the data be applied to their needs? By aligning your data storytelling with the audience's needs and interests, you can create a relevant and engaging story or presentation that effectively communicates the value of the data.</p> <p>Finally, when considering the context of the data, user stories can also be used to identify key insights and actionable steps that can be taken based on those insights. This helps to make the data more valuable and applicable to your audience, and helps them understand the implications of the data.</p> </details> </details> <details class=note> <summary>Data at the Heart of Modern Life</summary> <h2 id=data-at-the-heart-of-modern-life>Data at the Heart of Modern Life<a class=headerlink href=#data-at-the-heart-of-modern-life title="Permanent link">¶</a></h2> <p>In this section, we will explore the 5 Vs, the growth of IoT and sensing devices, the impact of mobile and cloud computing on data generations, and the importance of data in a pandemic.</p> <p>As our world becomes increasingly digitized, we are generating and collecting vast amounts of data from a variety of sources.

In fact, according to recent estimates, the average digital organization creates terabytes of data each day. Here’s a list of some important questions to consider, as the volume of data can have a significant impact.</p> <ul> <li>How much data does your digital organization create every day?</li> <li>How much of that data that is created by the organization needs to be collected?</li> <li>How much of the data is clean and is usable?</li> <li>How much of that data that is collected needs to be analyzed or processed?</li> <li>How much of that data that is collected needs to be retained?</li> <li>How will the volume of data impact the organization’s governance program?</li> <li>How much of the digital organization’s data is not being collected?</li> <li>Volume can be derived from # of users, # of endpoints, and other factors.</li> </ul> </details> <details class=info> <summary>Variety</summary> <h4 id=variety>Variety<a class=headerlink href=#variety title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4> <p>There is a growing movement within the cybersecurity industry to establish a common standard for sharing threat intelligence and communicating threat tactics and techniques. For example, Splunk recently announced a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to create the Splunk Security Lake, which aims to provide a centralized platform for storing, analyzing, and sharing security data. However, until there is a widely-accepted industry-wide standard for data sharing, organizations will continue to deal with a variety of data sources.</p> <p>Each firewall vendor has a different log format, and endpoint telemetry may contain more information than what is reported by the firewall. While these data sources can complement each other, the differences in format can make it difficult for organizations to effectively analyze and utilize the data. Splunk provides tools that can help normalize this variety of data using a Common Information Model (CIM). By using CIM, organizations can more easily integrate and analyze data from multiple sources, enabling them to make more informed security decisions.</p> <p>The following five items are key components of a successful data analytics program:</p> <dl> <dt><code>Integration</code></dt> <dd>This refers to the process of combining data from multiple sources, such as databases, systems, and applications, in order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the data.</dd> <dt><code>Quality</code></dt> <dd>Ensuring the quality of data is critical for accurate analysis and decision-making.

It is calculated using two factors: time and amount. Speed, frequency, volume, and variety are all components of data velocity that can impact how quickly data is generated and processed.</p> <p>Imagine trying to measure the flow of electricity in a circuit. Just like electricity, data can flow at different speeds and in different quantities. To accurately measure the flow of electricity, you would need to consider factors such as the amount of current (similar to volume in data), the frequency of the current (similar to frequency in data), and the type of load on the circuit (similar to variety in data). Similarly, to measure data velocity, you need to consider the speed at which data is generated, the frequency of data generation, the volume of data being generated, and the variety of data being generated.</p> <p>Understanding data velocity is important because it can help organizations make informed decisions about how to process and store data. For example, if an organization is dealing with high velocity data, it may need to invest in more powerful and efficient processing and storage systems in order to keep up with the volume and speed of data being generated. On the other hand, if an organization is dealing with low velocity data, it may be able to use less expensive and less powerful systems to process and store the data. By understanding data velocity, organizations can ensure that they have the right systems and infrastructure in place to support their data analytics efforts.</p> <p>Breaking down speed, frequency, volume, and variety:</p> <dl> <dt><code>Speed</code></dt> <dd>The velocity of data refers to how quickly data is generated and processed. With the increasing amount of data being generated, it is important for organizations to have the ability to process and analyze data in real-time or near real-time to keep up with the pace of change.</dd> <dt><code>Frequency</code></dt> <dd>The velocity of data also refers to the frequency at which data is generated and updated. Data that is generated and updated frequently may be more useful for decision-making, as it can provide a more current and accurate picture of the organization or industry.</dd> <dt><code>Volume</code></dt> <dd>The velocity of data is also impacted by the volume of data being generated. Organizations that generate a high volume of data may need to invest in more advanced technologies and processes to handle the volume and velocity of data effectively.</dd> <dt><code>Variety</code></dt> <dd>The velocity of data can also be impacted by the variety of data being generated. Data that comes from a variety of sources and formats may be more difficult to process and analyze quickly, which can impact the velocity of data.</dd> </dl> </details> <details class=info> <summary>Value</summary> <h4 id=value>Value<a class=headerlink href=#value title="Permanent link">¶</a></h4> <ul> <li>What is the value of a seashell? </li> <li>What is the value of a goat or a chicken?</li> <li>What is the value of 1 BTC?</li> <li>How about a Peso?</li> <li>The value of a piece of art is determined by a number of factors.</li> <li>The value of music, a concert ticket, or the autographed poster are all complex equations.</li> <li>What is the value of an hour of your time?</li> </ul> <p>The value of something is determined by how much it is worth to an individual or group.
