# Using ODAM to Setup Your ACE

??? note "Part III"
    ## Part III

    An Analytics Center of Excellence (ACE) is a dedicated team or function within an organization that is responsible for promoting and enabling the use of data analytics to support business objectives. The goal of an ACE is to provide a centralized resource for data analytics expertise, tools, and processes that can be leveraged across the organization to drive data-driven decision making and innovation. Some key responsibilities of an ACE include:

    - Defining and enforcing data governance policies and standards.
    - Identifying and prioritizing data analytics use cases.
    - Providing guidance and support to business units in the development and execution of data analytics projects.
    - Developing and maintaining a data analytics roadmap and strategy.
    - Providing training and enablement to data analysts and other team members.
    - Evaluating and selecting data analytics tools and technologies.

    The goal of an ACE is to help organizations derive value from their data assets by providing a centralized resource for data analytics expertise, tools, and processes.

??? note "Building a Data-Driven Culture: The Role of Communication, Engagement, and Collaboration"
    ## Building a Data-Driven Culture: The Role of Communication, Engagement, and Collaboration 

    Effective data analytics culture in an organization is built on a foundation of strong communication, engagement, and collaboration. One key element of this is regular office hours or "ask me anything" sessions, in which team members can ask questions, seek guidance, and share insights with one another. Outreach to the broader organization, through events, community building initiatives, and other forms of engagement, can also be important for fostering a data-driven culture. Establishing a feedback loop, through which team members can share their experiences and ideas, is another key component of building a successful data analytics culture. Finally, social proof - the idea that people are more likely to adopt a certain behavior or attitude if they see others doing the same - can be a powerful force in driving the adoption of data analytics practices and tools within an organization. By focusing on these key elements, organizations can build a culture that is conducive to the effective use of data analytics to drive business decisions and outcomes.
